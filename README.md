# PythonETL-projects

Did multiple ETL projects in jupyter lab using python and some of its data manipulation libraries like pandas and webscraping libraries like BeautifulSoup.
Projects consisted of extracting/collecting data from an API, csv, json and html, performing transformations after storing it in a dataframe, and finally loading the data in csv and json files.

_This project was part of a coursera course I had taken https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-engineering._
